# Netflix-Clone
Project Overview:
I created a Netflix clone to showcase my skills in HTML and CSS, focusing on replicating the user interface and design of the popular streaming service. This project emphasizes clean, responsive design and attention to detail in styling.

Features:

Responsive Design: The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Navigation Bar: Includes a navigation bar with links to different sections, mimicking the original Netflix interface.

Hero Section: Features a hero section with a background image, a call-to-action button, and engaging text content.

Movie Grid: Displays a grid of movie posters, with hover effects to enhance user interaction.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used to structure the content and layout of the webpage. The HTML includes semantic tags to ensure accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

CSS: Utilized for styling the webpage. Techniques like Flexbox and Grid were employed to create a responsive and visually appealing layout. CSS animations and transitions were used for interactive elements.
